# ADR-001: Use TypeScript for the Expense Tracker

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose between JavaScript and TypeScript for building our expense tracker application. The app will handle financial data and user inputs, so type safety and code reliability are important.

## Decision

We will use TypeScript for the entire project.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- Better IDE support with autocomplete and inline documentation
- Easier to refactor code as the project grows
- Type definitions make the code more self-documenting

**Negative:**
- Slightly more setup and configuration required
- Learning curve for developers new to TypeScript
- Need to write type definitions for our data models
